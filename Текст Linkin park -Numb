Numb

Fm#                  D
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
A                    E
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Fm#                  D
Don't know what you're expecting of me
A                    E
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

D                    E 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Fm#                  D
Every step I take is another mistake to you
A                    E 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
 
Fm#   A         D                    
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
A         E                 
Become so tired so much more aware
Fm#  A         D
I'm becoming this all I want to do
A              E            
Is be more like me and be less like you

Fm#                  D
Can't you see that you're smothering me
A                    E
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
Fm#                  D
Cause everything that you thought I would be
A                    E
Has fallen apart right in front of you
 
D                    E  
(Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertow)
Fm#                  D
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
A                    E 
(Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertow)
Fm#                  A                      E
And every second I waste is more than I can take
 
Fm#   A         D                    
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
A         E                 
Become so tired so much more aware
Fm#  A         D
I'm becoming this all I want to do
A              E            
Is be more like me and be less like you

 E
And I know
Fm#   A         D  
I may end up failing too
    E
But I know

  G#
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
 
Fm#   A         D                    
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
A         E                 
Become so tired so much more aware
Fm#  A         D
I'm becoming this all I want to do
A              E            
Is be more like me and be less like you
